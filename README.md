# Intelligent Knowledge Retrieval for Case Management

This project proposes a context-aware AI assistant for Appian that
automatically surfaces relevant policy clauses for active cases
with verifiable citations.

## Problem
Support agents handle complex cases and must search across
fragmented policy documents, increasing handling time and
compliance risk.

## Solution
A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that:
- Reads live case context
- Retrieves relevant policy documents
- Displays cited, verifiable answers inside Appian

## Status
Conceptual prototype for Appian AI Application Challenge 2026.
